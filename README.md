# L-store-Database
This is a quarter-long course project conducted in ECS 165A Database System at UC Davis. The project is developed in a set of three milestones, and each of them focuses on a few primary goals for a database system. After completing the project in a group of five members, Weiyi and I found the project interestring so we decided to spend some time over the spring break on re-designing and optimizing the database structure. We have analyzed our orignial database system and documented our progress while developing a new database structure.

# Milestones
Milestone 1: Single-threaded, in-memory L-Store.

Milestone 2: Two-threads, second thread on merge, buffer is a fixed size in memory and the rest of the database is stored on disk/file.

Milestone 3: Multi-threaded, in-memory & Durable L-Store.
